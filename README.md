Abstract

   This document describes the proposed architecture of Fault-tolerant
   Root for Yeti DNS.  It results from ongoing discussions during the
   launch of phase-2 for Yeti DNS Project towards a decentralized Root
   system.  This design intends to introduce the property of Fault-
   tolerance with redundancy and decentralized technology into the
   signing and publication function of Root.  Note that it is only high-
   level description of the design.  Details are to be contained in
   accompanying documentation.
